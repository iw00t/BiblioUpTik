# What is BibloUpTik?

If you're asking this question, you should be a Power User or above on Bib. You can find my thread in the "Power Users" forum; this explains the software in great detail.


# What do I do with this code?!

If you're a general user and are not interested in coding, then nothing.

However, if you are familiar with high level programming or are looking to get started, feel free to clone this repo and get hacking. I welcome any improvements and/or implementation of new features.
